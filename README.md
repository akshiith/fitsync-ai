#### Description: 
FitSync AI is an interactive, web-based fitness and wellness assistant built with Python and Streamlit. It aims to help individuals track, monitor, and improve their physical health by providing a suite of simple yet effective tools. Users can calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), receive daily hydration recommendations, monitor their sleep habits, and access structured workout and strength training programs — all from a clean and user-friendly interface.

The application uses a sidebar-based navigation menu, allowing users to easily switch between different modules:

The Home page introduces the app’s purpose and features.

The BMI Calculator computes users’ BMI based on weight and height inputs and provides feedback on health status.

The Hydration Tracker recommends the daily amount of water intake based on body weight, activity levels, and climate.

The Sleep Tracking feature helps users understand if they are getting enough rest, giving actionable suggestions.

The Workout Plan section provides a progressive fitness schedule, guiding users through Foundation, Progression, and Optimization phases.

The Strength Challenge offers a 30-day plan with beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels to boost endurance and strength.
